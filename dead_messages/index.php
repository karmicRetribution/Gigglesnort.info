        <h3>"AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" DISCLAIMER</h3>
      <p class="sideContent">The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects in all representations which make these Services or our customers happy, without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory, compelling, noloceptive, nonnegligent or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness to win, completeness, adequacy, narrative stability, ontological stability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, play-through, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no explanation, no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, that Your Service will comply reasonably, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, have a standard or acceptable price, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected, or offer any assurances of safety.</p>
      <p class="sideContent">Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider(s) makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation and safety or availability of the Service, or the information, functionality, design, reliability, technical or managerial accuracy, completeness and adequacy of content and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted, contiguous, easy access, safe in terms which include electronic and physical locations, or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, existence, or currency of any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or communications sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, memetics, scripts, trojan horses, malevolent entities, worms, infohazards, malware, timebombs or anything else used internally to attack anyone who may interact with the Services, or other harmful components.</p>
      <p class="sideContent">Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law. A copy of any waiver requested at sign-in is sufficient for determining whether such an exclusion exists.</p>

        <h3>GOVERNING LAW</h3>
      <p class="sideContent">The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your use of the Service.

        <h3>FOR EUROPEAN UNION (EU) USERS</h3>
      <p class="sideContent">If You are a European Union consumer, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident in. Your European Union provides a single right, from time to time, in accordance with local law.</p>

        <h3>UNITED STATES LEGAL COMPLIANCE</h3>

This is all a bunch of shitty racist, nationalist bullshit, but the way things are right now I don't feel right making any alterations to this particular set of stipulations, for fear of being carted off by my own government as it collapses into a black hole of fascism. Reality is the worst cyberpunk dystopia by far.</p>
