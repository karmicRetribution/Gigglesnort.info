      <h1 id="news">Farrago Fiction Announces Development of Massive Expansion to The Obscure World, Titled The Obscure Game.</h1>
      <p><strong>NEW YORK - <span id="date1">November </span><span id="date2">19, </span><span id="date3">2027</span> -</strong> Farrago Fiction, developers of the PC full-dive immersive VR MMO The Obscure World, revealed today in an online announcement that they have begun work on The Obscure Game. As of writing, there is no set release date, however the company has told fans to expect more information to be revealed in the coming year.</p>
      <p>According to Farrago Fiction President, Founder, and Lead Developer Jay Rogers, The Obscure Game is slated to be “a highly detailed sandbox-adventure experience set in the universe of The Obscure World.” Players of the VR MMO will be able to utilize its in-depth character customization system to bring their existing online avatars into The Obscure Game upon its release. Rogers also mentions that “The Obscure World and The Obscure Game will be linked together in more ways than one,” but leaves these ways a mystery.</p>
      <p>The Obscure World currently enjoys an active player count of 50,000 concurrent users and is only available on PC.
      <h2>About The Obscure World</h2>
      <p>The Obscure World is a full-dive immersive VR MMO that makes the most out of recent advances in virtual reality hardware in a way that truly allows players to step foot into fantastical worlds. The Obscure World’s character creation engine, called “FigureForge”, not only allows players to customize their avatar in whatever way they want, but also provides an easy-to-use interface allowing anyone to upload their own custom content. A similar system is utilized in the game’s “Worldcrafter” engine, through which imaginative players can design small but detailed worlds for others to explore. Farrago Fiction regularly updates The Obscure World both to add new content and host creation contests for users to participate in. The Obscure World is available only on PC and has over 100 thousand registered accounts.</p>

      <p>While The Obscure World is their best known work, Farrago Fiction has developed a wide range of software. Starting in 2017 with a confusing mixture of small simulations, every piece of software developed by Farrago Fiction has found is way into their flagship title. For example, Farrago Fiction’s first work, Frog Simulator, focused on the creation of unique frogs through a trial-and-error system, which is now used to create background animals in The Obscure World. Farrago Fiction is currently interested in the development of advanced artificial intelligence for gaming, which is likely to make an appearance in its upcoming product The Obscure Game.</p>
