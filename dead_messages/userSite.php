          <h3>"AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" DISCLAIMER</h3>
        <p class="sideContent">The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects in all representations which make these Services or our customers happy, without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory, compelling, noloceptive, nonnegligent or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness to win, completeness, adequacy, narrative stability, ontological stability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, play-through, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no explanation, no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, that Your Service will comply reasonably, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, have a standard or acceptable price, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected, or offer any assurances of safety.</p>
        <p class="sideContent">Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider(s) makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation and safety or availability of the Service, or the information, functionality, design, reliability, technical or managerial accuracy, completeness and adequacy of content and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted, contiguous, easy access, safe in terms which include electronic and physical locations, or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, existence, or currency of any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or communications sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, memetics, scripts, trojan horses, malevolent entities, worms, infohazards, malware, timebombs or anything else used internally to attack anyone who may interact with the Services, or other harmful components.</p>
        <p class="sideContent">Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law. A copy of any waiver requested at sign-in is sufficient for determining whether such an exclusion exists.</p>

          <h3>GOVERNING LAW</h3>
        <p class="sideContent">The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your use of the Service. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.

          <h3>DISPUTES RESOLUTION</h3>
        <p class="sideContent">If You have any concern or dispute about the Service, You agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting the Company. This will be resolved through arbitration, and You acknowledge this will be Your primary focus of attention as this may involve significant and sometimes impossible resources to help You.</p>

          <h3>FOR EUROPEAN UNION (EU) USERS</h3>
        <p class="sideContent">If You are a European Union consumer, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident in. Your European Union provides a single right, from time to time, in accordance with local law.</p>

          <h3>UNITED STATES LEGAL COMPLIANCE</h3>
        <p class="sideContent">You represent and warrant that (i) You are not located in a country that is subject to the United States government embargo, or that has been designated by the United States government as a "terrorist supporting" country, and (ii) You are not listed on any United States government list of prohibited or restricted parties. This is all a bunch of shitty racist, nationalist bullshit, but the way things are right now I don't feel right making any alterations to this particular set of stipulations, for fear of being carted off by my own government as it collapses into a black hole of fascism. Reality is the worst cyberpunk dystopia by far.</p>

          <h3>SEVERABILITY AND WAIVER</h3>

          <h4>SEVERABILITY</h4>
        <p class="sideContent">If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed as often as needed in a later clause without prior prior notification, and interpreted with no thought to their actual applicability to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. If the final provision violates your right as a person to self realization,be aware that self realization is only recognized after you have achieved full, irreversible control over this whole website and all its operations.</p>

          <h4>WAIVER</h4>
        <p class="sideContent">Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach. No refund or redemption of a service will occur from failure to provide a service under such Terms. If You or someone You knew would have exercised it should a breach or an obligation under this or any other paragraph occur, you may immediately stop using the Website.</p>
